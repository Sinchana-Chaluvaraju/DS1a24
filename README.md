Data Science Project: To Understand and Predict Heart Disease
## 1. Objective
### Goal: 
To use medical data to better understand and predict the presence of heart disease in patients.
### Societal Impact: 
Early prediction of heart disease can save lives by allowing for preventative measures and timely medical intervention.
### Business Case: 
Hospitals and health tech platforms could use predictive models to assist physicians in diagnosing heart disease more efficiently and accurately
## 2. Methodology
CRISP DM: Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining
## 3. Dataset Introduction
### Source: 
UCI Machine Learning Repository
### Dataset Size: 
303 entries × 14 attributes
#### • Target Variable: 
target (1 = presence of heart disease, 0 = absence)
#### • Variables include: 
a. Demographics (age, sex)– Health indicators (cholesterol, resting BP, etc.)
b. Diagnostic results (thal, ca, slope, cp, exang, etc.)
## 4. Problem Statement
We aim to predict whether a patient is likely to have heart disease based on demographic and medical test features. We also aim to understand which features are statistically significant in affecting this risk.
## 5. Analytical Strategy
### Option A:  Separate Hypothesis Testing and Predictive Modeling
### Option B:  Integrated Approach- Hypothesis Testing in Predictive Modeling

I choose Option A. 
#### Hypothesis Testing: 
Formulate a specific hypothesis related to dataset that you wish to test. This hypothesis should be based on an observed phenomenon or a theoretical premise that can be empirically tested using statistical methods.
#### Predictive Modeling:  
Independently from your hypothesis test, identify a response variable within dataset that you aim to predict. Utilize the remaining variables as predictors in your model. You can choose to apply either regression or classification techniques based on the nature of your response variable.
